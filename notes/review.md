looking back
Overall, I feel like I've made some progress in my current job recently. I've been able to identify some aspects of the work that really interest me and align with my passions. Moving forward, I know that it's important to keep pushing myself to pursue these areas and to stand up for myself when it comes to taking on projects that I feel strongly about.

One thing that I've been doing to broaden my horizons is trying to learn more about what other teams do within TD Bank. I think this is important not only for my own personal development, but also for the success of the company as a whole. By understanding more about how different teams operate and what their goals are, I can better collaborate with them and contribute to their efforts.

Even when I'm working on tasks that don't necessarily align with my passions, I've tried to maintain a positive attitude and focus on how I can help the team as a whole. This has meant taking on various reporting and paperwork tasks, even though they're not my favorite things to do. At the end of the day, I know that these tasks are important for keeping things running smoothly and supporting my colleagues, so I'm happy to contribute in any way I can.

Finally, I've tried to be a helpful resource for new team members whenever possible. I think it's important to support others and help them get up to speed, but I also recognize the importance of not stretching myself too thin. So while I've been happy to lend a hand within my own capacity and time constraints, I've also made sure to prioritize my own workload and responsibilities.

As a seasoned employee, I have also taken on the responsibility of helping new hires integrate into the company culture and learn the necessary skills to excel in their roles. However, I recognize that there may be times when I need to say no and prioritize my own workload. I will work to strike a balance between helping others and taking care of my own responsibilities.
